# PicoSynth \- A DIY Digital/Analog Synthesizer

Attempting to bridge the gap between software and hardware in a way my brain can cope with.

# Software:

- Custom waveform library from scratch in C++ (too lazy to learn C for this project)w  
- Phase-accumulator oscillators (sine, saw, triangle)  
- ADSR envelope generator \- for aesthetics  
- Most likely power management (not too sure how that works yet)

# Hardware:

* Raspberry Pi Pico H  
* Breadboard (plug and play is less work than soldering and allows for mistakes)  
* Pimoroni Pico Audio Pack (Quality audio for my ears)  
* Pimoroni RGB Keypad (Pretty colors, flashy lights)  
* Potentiometers for implemented effects  
* Power regulator (I promised my mom I wouldn’t blow anything up)


I mostly have no idea what I’m doing. I live on stack overflow and whatever I can get my hands on for figuring out the hardware. This IS a learning experience, but it’s fun. And a reasonably priced hobby for now.
